      <description>We have 5 PhD positions open for applications at the University of Groningen within the Godwit Landscapes Project: bio-indicators of ecologically sustainable farming. The positions are part of a larger project funded by LNV (Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food quality), European LIFE integrated projects (LIFE IP), the Province of Frysl√¢n and Birdlife Netherlands with the Black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa limosa) as our focal species. Within a landscape-scale ecosystem-based approach, that connects a long-term monitored population of godwits to changes in land-use, distribution of food sources and predators, we aim to understand how declining trends in farmland biodiversity can be reversed by more sustainable agricultural practices.</description>

      <description>Our world is constantly cycling, with seasons passing by, the day coming after the night, the moon turning around the Earth and driving tidal rhythms. All living organisms have to align their lives with these cycles. It has long been studied how the ancient time-keeping programs regulate animal physiological and behavioural cycles at annual, daily or tidal or lunar scales. In avian chronobiology, experiments by Ebo Gwinner and Viktor Dolnik have become a classic.</description>
