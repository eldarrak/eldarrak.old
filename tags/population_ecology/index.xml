      <description>Where and how populations of seasonal migrants are limited? How parts of the annual cycle are interconnected? How migrants adjust to the ongoing changes?  To a great surprise we still have very limited answer to this questions. My current understanding is that there is not default limiting time or place and migratory populations respond to the selection pressures by adjusting their distributions in time and space. Together with Theunis Piersma, my teacher in Flyway Ecology, and his team we have already obtained some interesting results:</description>

      <description>I had a pleasure to work in Ithaca with David Winkler. He started and for many years maintains a huge colony of nest boxes. Tree swallows living in these boxes are cute birds with low survival rates and this makes them different from shorebirds I used to work before. These birds just have to reproduce, so they arrive super early to get a nest box. Lay second clutch if the first was not successful and have to find food despite coldsnaps.</description>
